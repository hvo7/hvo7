Hello, I'm Henry. 

I am a data professional with expertise in Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. 

I'm interested in solving business problems using data-driven solutions using the methodologies of a scientist, where experimentation and measurable results drive every decision.

My most recent project is: [Customer Retention Analysis](https://github.com/hvo7/Customer-Retention-Analysis)

I am currently working on: [Plan Purchase Friction Tracker](https://github.com/hvo7/Plan-Purchase-Friction-Tracker)
